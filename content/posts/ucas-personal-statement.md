title: "How to get your personal statement the right length for UCAS"
---

UCAS tells you that your personal statement needs to be a maximum of 4,000 characters or
47 lines long.

## Problem
You write your personal statement, it's just under 4000 characters and almost 47 lines
long. You submit it in UCAS and... you're told it doesn't meet the requirements. What?

It turns out that UCAS does a bit of editing of your personal statement, and then
applies the requirements to the edited version. The only way to figure this out is trial
and error, it would seem.

## Solution

When you submit your personal statement, UCAS will wrap your lines at a **maximum of 88
characters per line**, by inserting a new line character after the last full word under
this limit.

Your 47 line limit applies *after this step*. Any line breaks you inserted in your
original *will be kept*, meaning this is likely to push you over the 47 line
limit if you were close to it in your original.

The personal statement requirements should really say
- A maximum of 88 characters per line
- A maximum of 47 lines total
- A maximum of 4,000 characters total


**The only way to actually get up to 4,000 characters is for you to not have paragraph
breaks**. In other words, the only way to get all the way to the 4,000 character limit
is to just paste a wall of text. This is probably a bad idea, as it will make your
statement harder to read for the admissions officer.

Assuming you want a few paragraph breaks in your statement, you **realistically want to
aim for under about 3,600 characters**.

## Configure your text editor

I recommend that you **configure your text editor to automatically wrap lines at 88
characters** so that you can see what line number UCAS will consider you to have reached
as you edit. It will also let you see exactly what the final UCAS version will look
like, as the automatic insertion of new lines can potentially make your intentional like
breaks look a bit odd.

Every text editor is different so I can't tell you how to do it, but I recommend you
just use a simple plain text notepad-style editor, as you can only insert plain text
into UCAS anyway. And if you can't figure out how to set your editor to word wrap, you
can just shrink the size of the window until it reaches the correct length.

I am not a current applicant, I am writing this based on my memory of the
trial-and-error process I went through when I was an applicant in the past. It's
possible I have misunderstood something or that the system has changed.
